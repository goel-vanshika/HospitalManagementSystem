# HospitalManagementSystem
About this Project
Made by Vanshika Goel
Hospital Management System has today become an indispensable part of any hospital/clinic/healthcare facility. This HMS is built from the perspective of a medical employee, for eg. doctor or a medical officer. This database has been built by connecting all the tables through foreign key constraints with the parent tables, Doctor and Patient. This ensures easier access to patient data, like Inpatient Department or Appointments. This can be expanded to all departments like Radiology and Pathology and also allow for easy access to reports or scans, without having to always switch between these tabs.

This was built after careful discussion with my parents, who are doctors by profession, keeping in mind, the expected functionalities, like Patient ID, a patientâ€™s allergies, emergency contact details, etc.
